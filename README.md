reimplementation of libloragw in go

https://github.com/Lora-net/lora_gateway

only receiving side is implemented yet

the main difference with the original is that libloragw handles state internally and state is wired out so multiple radio frondends can be handled simultaneously

HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
